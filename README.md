# surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis
Our client, W. Avy, is interested in opening a new start-up surf and ice-cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  W. Avy wants to be sure that this would be a wise business investment that could be profitable throughout the entire year.  Climate temperature was his biggest concern; so to help get a better understanding, we needed to extract weather data during what might be considered the hottest and coldest months of the year, on avearge.  Therefore, two seperate queries were completed for the months of June and December using data acquired through the SQLAlchemy database.  After extracting all the necessary temperature information, we are able to create data frames that will help W. Avy evaluate and compare the temperature extremes for Oahu, and be able to make an informed business decision.
